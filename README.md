# VBA-Challenge

This repository contains an excel spreadsheet with three VBA modules associated with it.

The spreadsheet itself contains data on stocks over the period from 2018-2020. This data includes information on fluctuations in the stocks value day-to-day over this period, as well as the stock volume and daily highs and lows.

The first module, Stock_Data, pulls from this dataset and analyzes it to find each stock's  Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Volume over a year.

The second module, Conditional_Formatting, colors the output of the "Yearly Change", marking it green if its a positive change and red if its a negative change.

The third module, Max_Finder, finds the stocks that had the Greatest Percentage Increase, Greatest Percentage Decrease, and Greatest Stock Volume in each given year. It pulls this data, adding it to the spreadsheet.

Each of these modules loops through multiple spreadsheets to seperately process the data on each of them.

Also attached are screenshots of the excel sheet when all of the formulas have been run.
